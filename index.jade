            h3 Meet the Business Owners: Roman, Gabriel and Michael B.

            p  With a combination of over 50 years experience in hairdressing these three partners have travelled the world teaching education on the latest trends. Fast forward to the present day these 3 inspiring minds collaborate with a vision to offer the perfect cut & color for our clients along with exceptional customer service, And what better way to do it than having the most brilliant, and creative staff departmentalized to know what’s best for the individual

            p Essensuals London, the company, began in London in 1997 when Toni, Sacha and Christian Mascolo first recognised a gap in the market for a ‘Diffusion line’ of their high end hair salons.

            p Essensuals London at the shops at Legacy is the first franchise in the United States. Established in 2011. Essensuals London is proud of its heritage and success. The brand’s foundations and educational systems are comfortably and firmly entrenched within the high fashion industry of the United Kingdom. 34 Essenuals salons can be found in the UK as well as 28 international salons. Essensuals is well and truly on its way to achieving its goal of becoming a highly respected and globally recognised hairdressing brand.

            p <strong><em>Appointments</em></strong>

            p Please arrive 5-10 minutes before your scheduled appointment. We require 24 hour notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment. We understand that occasionally the unexpected happens. If you have a history of 2 or more last minute cancellations or "no shows", we will require a $50 deposit to reserve your appointment.  Arriving late will likely limit the time allocated for your service. If you are running late, please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. If you are more than 15 minutes late for your appointment, however, you may have to wait or be rescheduled with another available stylist. If there is just not enough time to do the service, we will have to reschedule. For appointments 30 minutes in length or less, we can only allow a 10 minute grace period. These rescheduled appointments will be recorded as a "no show”.
